  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.apple.com/macosx/images/buystrip_snow_box_20090824.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard" />I have now installed Snow Leopard on 3 machines (1 more to
go plus a server).</p>

<p>I had waited about a week and between the effort the vendors put in before the
release and the updates that came out a bit later, only a few issues arose
during the upgrade process.</p>

<p>I am able to use the built-in CISCO VPN support and after I fixed the
<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2009082703155512&amp;query=ipsec%2Bpassword">keychain access issue</a>, I did not have to supply my password every
connection.  I also learned that one can use CMD+SHIFT+G to change a browse
window to another directory including the ones that are not easily browsable
by the Apple GUI.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about conversion of e-mail from IMAP to Exchange servers to the new
Apple-Exchange 2007 Web Services approach in another post.</p>

<p>I did have to specifically upgrade Microsoft&rsquo;s Remote Desktop connection
product as it had not auto-updated (or informed me) to its <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974283">recent
release</a>.  It may be it just needed a &ldquo;re-install&rdquo; to insert special bits
somewhere.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://aloiroberto.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/snow-leopard-system-events-app-resolved/">others</a>, on one machine wanted to know where System Events.app was.
I was presented a GUI to browse to the file (and found it it in
System/Library/CoreServices.)</p>

<p>A few of the Mail.app plug-ins have not been upgraded yet.  These were
automatically disabled.</p>

<p>The DVD includes the latest Xcode (3.2) which I installed and Rosetta which is
an option item which I did not do yet.  I am going to try to do without the
old programs that only work natively on the PowerPC.  We will see.</p>

<p>Thank goodness Quicksilver still works.  That would be a loss even though
there is a new Google tool that is similar.  I modified it to search
/Developer for type com.apple.application to pick up those tools on one
machine &mdash; evidently I had already done it on my other development machine.</p>

<p>I turned Time Machine off on the one machine I use it on during the update and
for a couple days in case of the need to retreat.  I have restarted Time
Machine, but as one would expect, it is taking a while to catch up to such
massive changes to the disk.  Another approach would have been to flush the
past and just start the drive over.</p>

<p>Like others, I use applications hosted in Oracle.  Those applications are not
yet certified for Java 1.6 and one of them did not work with Safari at a
critical point in the application.  I found that if I set Safari to run in
32bit mode (most of my machines are Intel Duo Core 2 and thus 64 bit capable
to one degree or another), that the application worked as it did before the
upgrade. To choose 32bit mode, select the application in Finder, and then &ldquo;Get
Info&rdquo;.  On the pane, there is check box to run in 32 bit mode.</p>

<p>I have verified I can do SMB connections to printers and servers as well.</p>

<p>On one machine I had to fix my MacTeX installation in a minor way as
<a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/faq/#qm10">described by the MacTeX folks at Tug</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update this post if I remember (or encounter other things) in a bit.</p>

<p>All in all, much less traumatic than the move to Leopard and we will stay away
from discussion migrations in other OS&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><strong>Update 9/16/09:</strong> There seems to be a new 32b version of Java 1.6 in Snow
Leopard and there is no other version.  So while I had the experience reported
above, it seems I don&rsquo;t have an understanding of &ldquo;why&rdquo; and at this point,
after 10.6.1 patch (if that matters), my Oracle application is working in both
32bit and 64bit modes of Safari.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using Apple&rsquo;s Mail.app as my client to talk to the University&rsquo;s
Exchange 2007 server.  I really don&rsquo;t like the monster database file that
Microsoft&rsquo;s Entourage product uses which is not friendly to incremental
backups.  I have been using the IMAP protocol for Mail, forgone task,
calendar, and contacts synchronization, and since I sync my iCal calendar with
Google&rsquo;s Calendar, I use Google&rsquo;s GSync on a dedicated PC to one-way sync my
calendar into Exchange.  This works because I am really only trying to show
other university calendar users my &ldquo;Free-Busy&rdquo; information not precise
details.</p>

<p>With Snow Leopard, Apple has included support for the new Exchange Web
Services interface that Microsoft has put into Exchange 2007 and that
Entourage (with the web services patch) has just started using.  Microsoft&rsquo;s
MacBiz Unit team has stated that the web services are Microsoft&rsquo;s long term
protocol for Exchange clients (Mac and PC) &mdash; we will see about that.</p>

<p>Anyway, now Mail.app will use web services to interface with Exchange 2007 for
both incoming mail (and local synchronized store of same) and for outgoing
mail.  So there is no &ldquo;SMTP&rdquo; being emitted from the client machine.  This is
similar to the protocol footprint one has when using Google Mail either in a
web browser or using <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">MailPlane</a> as I usually do.</p>

<p>Additionally, one gets separate sections in Apple iCal and Apple AddressBook
to synchronize with the corresponding parts in Exchange.  One also picks up
groups scheduling with access to the free-busy information of other Exchange
users.  Right now, I am still thinking through if I will change my really well
working synchronization scheme to let Exchange fully participate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of posts today. In recording my Snow Leopard experiences, it occurred to
me that a decision I made recently regarding handling of sent mail had not
been documented.  Since I am pretty satisfied, it seems time to document it.
This is NOT specific to any particular mail client other than it probably does
not make sense with Google mail and it&rsquo;s tag approach.</p>

<p>For years, I have told the mail client to put a copy of each message I sent
into a &ldquo;sent mail&rdquo; folder.  I have sometimes chosen to purge messages I did
not think were worth keeping from there, sometimes just offloaded the whole
file yearly into another tool, and sometimes tried to move messages that went
with particular conversations into a folder with the rest of the thread.</p>

<p>I have also played around with BCCing myself on messages.  This lets you know
the message made it out (for most mail clients) and also forces you to think
if there are any more actions to take now that you have sent the mail.
Possible actions include 1) scheduling a follow-up, 2) recording the data you
supplied in the message in another system, storing the message in folder with
the rest of the thread, etc.</p>

<p>About a month ago, I have decided to no longer store sent items on the server
but rather to store them locally on the client, to BCC myself on all messages,
and to automatically purge local sent items after 30 days.  My operating
approach is the BCC&#8217;ed message that falls into my inbox gets immediate
attention and I will process as appropriate as well as make a long term
archive decision.  Sent messages will hang around from where they were sent
for 30 days in case something goes wrong &mdash; most of the time, the only thing
that goes wrong happens very soon since messages that I don&rsquo;t decide to
archive don&rsquo;t have any long term value.</p>

<p>Anyway, that is my new steady state approach for mail where I have folder-
control and I like it.</p>

<p>The other half of my mail is served by Google.</p>

<p>I am presently letting Google do what Google does <G>.  My present thought is
that if I were to use Google through an IMAP interface and use the above
approach, I would not be successful because Google would only have one message
(not the BCC one and the sent one) and if I auto-delete (tag as trash) I&rsquo;ll
lose the ones that are also tagged with something else (appear to be in a
folder) but I have not experimented yet.</p>

<p><strong>Update 9/13/2009:</strong> Outlook 2007 won&rsquo;t BCC the sender without extra code or
a plug-in (sigh).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The details are given in <a href="http://thiamteck.blogspot.com/2007/11/determine-java-class-file-version.html">Thiam Teck&rsquo;s Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the command</p>

<pre><code>javap -verbose ClassName
</code></pre>

<p>is given and the extensive dump is mined for the major version and minor
version of java used. The cited blog gives a table of major/minor pairs that
go from 1.0 through 1.6.</p>

<p>Another way (if you have binary dump program) is to look at the first 8 bytes
of the .class file as discussed in <a href="http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0544.html">Real&rsquo;s How To</a>. For my <a href="https://dgreenteach.org/DGreen/java_ex/SimpleClient/SClient0.class">example
file</a>, the first bytes are:</p>

<pre><code>CA FE BA BE 00 03 00 2D
</code></pre>

<p>The first four bytes <code>CA FE BA BE</code> are a signature for a .CLASS file, while
the next two bytes are the minor version (3) and the major version (2D or 45
base 10). The cited article (and the JVM documentation) will match this up to
JVM 1.1 for the example file. Version 1.5 of the JVM runs this class file with
no problem.  Real&rsquo;s How To also gives a sample program for those who have a
binary editor.</p>

<blockquote><p>From | Pathfinder Software Development | Blogs .</p></blockquote>

<p>I have given this story in other forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a video projector</li>
<li>Putting the machine to sleep</li>
<li>Migrating to a newer machine</li>
<li>Connecting a new printer</li>
</ul>


<p>Etc.</p>

<p>My punch line:  no doubt the ease of use and better designed experience are
worth the money once you experience them.  It is harder to see how one pushes
that &ldquo;promise&rdquo; to someone who has not yet made the buy decision and is
focusing on the incremental cost.  So far, it seems that it usually takes an
acquaintance who has already been through it to help.</p>

<p>The other way for a few is the Mac Mini which lowers but does not eliminate
the differential.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, so maybe no one will ever need it but I did (or so I thought) so after not
finding code available, I wrote it.</p>

<p>Basically, I needed to make a timestamp in an old version of ASP.  There are a
few date string conversions in the VB of ASP but not the one I needed.  The
newer ASP.NET has a richer collection but that was not the engine of the day.</p>

<p>I ended up with a function:</p>

<pre><code>' Convert number to string with leading zero if needed
' Accepts 0 and up
' if 0-9 return 00, 01, ... 09
' if &gt; 10 &lt; 99 return number as text
' if &gt; 100, modulus number to between 0 and 99

Function Return2CharForNumber( Value )
  TwoDigit = Value Mod 100
  If (TwoDigit &gt; 9) Then
    Return2CharForNumber = CStr(TwoDigit)
  Else
    Return2CharForNumber = "0" &amp; CStr(TwoDigit)
  End If
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>which was used like this for a timestamp:</p>

<pre><code>  ThisYear = Return2CharForNumber(year(date()))
  ThisMonth = Return2CharForNumber(month(date()))
  ThisDay = Return2CharForNumber(day(date()))
  TimeStamp = ThisYear &amp; ThisMonth &amp; ThisDay
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing to brag about but I wanted to put out there in case it was any use to
anyone (including me at a later time).</p>

<p>Now the sad truth, after writing it, debugging it, and deploying it &mdash; the
interface changed back close to what was already in the code so the above is
no longer needed.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
