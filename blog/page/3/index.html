  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was working on a the last note and wanted to check things out under a fresh
install. I decided to make a new Mac User to accomplish this. I used GitHub
for the Mac, Safari on the Assembla site and the Tumblr site, and the command
line. When I finsihed my work, I idlely was thinking about keeping this user
account around for the next effort or deleting it. One of the consideration
was how much space was in use by the account. I was shocked to see that the
home directory took 330MB!</p>

<p>Looking into it, I found the bit space was 300MB in Preferences. The other two
large directories was Caches (30MB) and Applications Support (12MB). Inside
preferences was a folder SMDHelpData that was the space user. This folder
evidently has the help file information: info, caches, and indexes for finding
things for all the applications on the system (not just those that had been
used). I am guessing there is a distinct copy per user since in theory at
least, one could through security settings block different users from various
components. There may also be some personalization (highlighting, last
location, etc.) capability.</p>

<p>I was very surprised at how much space was taken but I decided my lesson was
to also trade space for functionality (enough performance) and leave the user
configured so I would not spend time repeating the building of this space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> has now made a nice simple GUI tool for both <a href="http://mac.github.com">OS X</a> and
<a href="http://windows.github.com">Windows</a>. They have made them freely available for download. They seem to
have made careful choices about what to support and not support in order to
keep tool as simple as possible. They do support using GitHub<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> against
other git repositories such as Assembla or a homegrown one. They don&rsquo;t support
multiple remote repositories for a specific local repository but you are free
to use GitHub.com for one project<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and Assembla (for example) for
another. The two limitations that I have seen that &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; sometimes are</p>

<ol>
<li> There is no graphical view of the change tree (while confusing, if you need it, alternatives are even more confusing)</li>
<li> The Windows and Mac Clients look different and behave a bit different.</li>
<li> Github really knows you by the name/email you list in it&rsquo;s configuration and does not like/support your having a separate identity on a per project basis.</li>
</ol>


<p>These limitations are not fundamental and Github.com may work on them in the
future. There have been frequent updates thus far to Github &mdash; perhaps they
will continue.</p>

<h2>Using GitHub with an existing project hosted in Assembla</h2>

<p>If this is your first use of Assembla (but assuming you already have an
account), then you will need to update your Assembla profile with your public
ssh key. This file may exist on your system <code>~/.ssh/pub.rsa</code> where <code>~</code> refers
to your home directory. You probably generated this as part of your git
install but if not (and after you possibily install ssh), use</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -C "demo@example.com" -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>substituing your email address. Take the defaults (hit return) on everything
unless there is an offer to overwrite the pub.rsa file AND you need the pre-
existing one! You will now a the file you need. Go to your profile in
Assembla, select manage keys and upload this file to assembla.</p>

<p>If there is no local repository associated with the existing project, you will
need to clone it using the command line. Assembla gives the step by step
instructions personalized for the repository (see the &ldquo;git clone&rdquo; information
near the top of the Source/Git tab). Be sure to use the &ldquo;clone/push URL&rdquo; if
you are planning to push back to Assembla in the future.</p>

<p>After you have a local repository (start here if you already had one), merely
start up GitHub, and use the menu to select <code>File | Add Local Repository</code>
option selecting the directory containing the project repository.</p>

<h2>Starting a new project with GitHub and Assembla</h2>

<p>Make your Assembla Space in Assembla selecting an option that includes
Source/Git repository. After it is made, you will be on a page that contains
very useful &ldquo;Getting started with Git&rdquo; instructions. For this note, I assume
you have installed git and configured it with your name and email.</p>

<p>If you are starting the project, create your repository folder as you would
any folder, perhaps</p>

<pre><code> mkdir demo
</code></pre>

<p>Attach a terminal window to this new directory (new project) or the existing
directory corresponding to the top of your existing project.</p>

<pre><code> cd demo
</code></pre>

<p>Then, assuming you have not been using git and a local respository only,
initialize git</p>

<pre><code> git init
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a new project, you need at least one file. Create one &mdash; prehaps a
readme.txt file.</p>

<pre><code> echo "" &gt; readme.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Out of scope for this note but if it is an existing project not yet in git,
you may wish to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files">set up a .gitignore file</a> to keep certain files (or file
types) from being tracked. We will assume we are tracking everything for
simplicity here.</p>

<p>Now, we need to add all new (or changed files)_for tracking and commit the
present state of the files to the local repository. We will use &ldquo;First commit&rdquo;
as the message about this commit. Adjust as desired but limit yourself to one
line of information unless you know how to do multiple lines as one command in
your terminal (command) program.</p>

<pre><code>git add .  
git commit -m "First commit"
</code></pre>

<p>Now configure the repository to know where the remote repository is in
Assembla. Be sure to use the customized one on your Assembla instructions.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin git@git.assembla.com:demo.git
</code></pre>

<p>where demo is the name of the remote repository as known to Assembla.</p>

<p>Finally, send your first commit up to the remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Success. You can now switch to Github as noted for an existing git reponsitory
above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying out the EPUB export of <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a> and figured out I had to
make a cover page in the tool as well as a collection. I then filled out the
metadata including author information (David Green <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x75;&#x73;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#100;&#x40;&#x73;&#105;&#x74;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x75;&#x73;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#x64;&#64;&#x73;&#105;&#x74;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a>) and then
saved with an .epub extension.</p>

<p>Things ran fine but when I moved it over to the iPad as an iBook file, I was
told it was an invalid format. Alas, googling did not help me (it has to
happen every once in a while).</p>

<p>After a goodly bit of exploring, the problem was the e-mail address in angle
brackets as part of the author information. I removed them and things were
good to go.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <strong>path</strong> is an environmental variable that tells the command line (shell)
processor where to look for programs (commands) to run when they are entered
on the command line without any directory information. The shell will look for
the command in all the directories listed in the path variable.</p>

<p>In OS X, the active path can be shown when in the terminal window by typing
<code>echo $PATH</code> command on the command line (where <code>[user@system ~]$</code> is the
command line prompt and the text right before the &ldquo;]&rdquo; is the present working
directory (pwd). If it is &ldquo;~&rdquo; then it is the home directory of the user,
typically something like /Users/user (for a user named user).</p>

<pre><code> [user@system ~]$ echo $PATH
</code></pre>

<p>The path in OS X is maintained in several places:</p>

<ul>
<li>.bash_profile</li>
<li>.bashrc</li>
<li>system versions of the above</li>
<li>.MacOSX/environment.plist</li>
</ul>


<p>There a lot of references for the first three since this is roughly the same
as Linux/Unix assuming both systems are using the bash terminal shell. An
example is in <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2621/os_x_change_path_environment_variable/">Tech-Recipes</a>.</p>

<p>.MacOSX/environment.plist is obviously specialized to OS X, and this path
modification is seen by the GUI as well as command line programs run in the
terminal window. If the directory does not exist, you can make it at the
terminal prompt:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system ~]$ mkdir .MacOSX
</code></pre>

<p>Today, the file, if it exists, may be stored in binary rather than in text
form:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system ~]$ cd .MacOSX
[user@system .MacOSX]$ more environment.plist
"environment.plist" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?
</code></pre>

<p>is indicative of the file being binary. The command <code>plutil</code> can convert this
binary file to text oriented:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system .MacOSX]$ plutil -convert xml1 environment.plist
</code></pre>

<p>at this point, you can edit it carefully to contain your path. It must be a
complete collection where each path is separated by a &ldquo;:&rdquo; and the file must
obey XML rules. Mine looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;PATH&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/local/bin&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can either edit the file by hand with your favorite text editor, or if you
have Xcode installed, there is a tool to edit the file in a structured manner.
The tool may be able to work without conversion from binary to xml.</p>

<p>After editing the file, you may wish to convert it back to binary (although I
don&rsquo;t think it is necessary) by</p>

<pre><code>[user@system .MacOSX]$ plutil -convert binary1 environment.plist
</code></pre>

<p>After changing this file, you will have to either logout or reboot so that all
the OS X parts associated with your login will use this new path.</p>

less antagonistic than many. Evidently 68 accounts got exposed when the
password glitch happened.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I turned on (for a few minutes) deletions of iCal events. Some of my calendars
are hosted in Exchange and some on Google. Some of these events are group
meetings with group scheduling in place. My calendar appointments with other
individuals are both inside the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Google&rdquo; space and outside.</p>

<p>iCal is notifying all these individuals of the deleted group meetings (from 2
or more years ago since I said delete after 730 days) that the meeting has
been canceled. Of course, it happened long ago &mdash; it was not cancelled. Alas,
all of these individuals are getting e-mail announcing these cancelations from
me (via automated iCal behavior).</p>

<p>Broke, broke, broke!</p>

<p>(bug report submitted to Apple, there are discussions in the Apple Forum on
this issue.)</p>
