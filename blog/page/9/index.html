  <div class="entry-content"><p>OS X made the jump to a 64bit platform with 10.6 Snow Leopard.  Of course, not
everything is written for 64 bit mode at present.  The Universal file format
allows for binaries to be containers hold many different copies of the same
code but for different architectures.</p>

<p>So specifically, I was trying to build the latest <strong>rcov</strong> for the platform to
run under the now creaky old Locomotive shell I have been modifying to keep my
development rails environments separate from the OS&rsquo;s installation.  Dutifully
giving the command while inside a terminal session where the paths map to
locations within the Locomotive container:</p>

<p><code>gem install rcov</code></p>

<p>was giving the right &ldquo;words&rdquo; for output including the fact that the binary
extensions were being built (although it happened really quickly!).  Looking
inside, I found the rcovrt.bundle that was built and verified it was being
copied into position.</p>

<p>But using</p>

<p><code>file rcovrt.bundle</code></p>

<p>I found that it was a <code>Mach-O x86_64</code> rather than like the other bundles that
were already there that were <code>Mach-O i386</code> bundles.</p>

<p>I found the <code>Makefile</code> for the rcovrt code and tried it.</p>

<p>`make clean</p>

<blockquote><p>make<br> make install`</p></blockquote>

<p>Based on hints from <a href="http://blog.d27n.com/2009/08/26/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-rails-mysql-and-sphinx/">Mac OS X Snow Leopard + Rails, MySQL, and Sphinx</a>, I
added</p>

<p><code>-arch i386</code></p>

<p>to all <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>CXXFLAGS</code>, <code>LDFLAGS</code>, <code>LDSHARED</code> variables, redid the
&ldquo;<code>make</code> dance&rdquo;.  Success, I had the right type bundle in the right place and
everything was working again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife asked me about a strange number that had shown up on her cell phone.
She went to the Google and found out that it had been reported by others.
Some as &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo;, some for bill collectors, some for solicitations,
etc.</p>

<p>It turns out I that I had called her using Skype and I don&rsquo;t have a caller-id
number set to my cell phone or a SKYPE IN number so the dial out number is
from a pool and that pool number gets a lot of use.  Of course, no is posting
&ldquo;my husband&rdquo; called on this number since those with explanation (and
presumably desired calls) don&rsquo;t generate the energy to post to the net.</p>

<p>The solution choices seem to be to</p>

<ol>
<li><p> buy SKYPE IN to get a specific number  $75/yr (plus ability for folks to
call in)</p></li>
<li><p> map number to one&rsquo;s cell phone</p></li>
<li><p> map number to one&rsquo;s Google Voice number</p></li>
<li><p> live with issue</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I was going to try choice #3.  To do this, the Google Voice number has to
receive SMS.  One way to do this is to map SMS messages to Google Voice to
one&rsquo;s e-mail.  Note it costs you $0.11 on Skype to send the configuration
message.  After a substantial number for $0.11 attempts, I was not able to get
the underlying SMS message (it never showed in Google Mail.)  So for the
moment, I am using option 4 while I weigh the tradeoffs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of work has been done by the Subversion team (probably in response to
Git).  One can now do a merge from a project branch back into the main trunk
rather easy:</p>

<p><code>svn merge ^/tags/version-1.6.1/</code></p>

<p>will merge changes in 1.6.1 not in the trunk.  The ^ is relative remote
addressing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p><code>svn merge --dry-run --revision 944:945 ^/trunk/oumgt/</code></p>

<p>will show you the actions that would be taken if one asked to merge revision
945 from the trunk/oumgt/ space into the present present space.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Related example:</p>

<p><code>svn merge --dry-run ^/trunk/oumgt/</code></p>

<p>will show you the actions that would be taken if one wishes to apply all
revisions in trunk/oumgt/ space but not in the present present space.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong></p>

<p>SVN is still limited in how it can track changes and moving things back and
forth will eventually cause trouble. In short, one should decide to mostly
merge in one direction. The approved way to merge in the opposite direction is
to do a &ldquo;&mdash;reintegrate&rdquo; merge after which one should no longer use the branch
merged from. This page describes things at <a href="http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2008/07/subversion-merg.html">SVN 1.5</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instructors and projects usually have documentation standards.  The <a href="https://dgreenteach.org/DGreen/java_ex/JavaDocStyle.html">standards
I supply my students</a> are an abbreviated version of what a project team
might use.</p>

<p>NetBeans can be customized to help.  In this note, I will limit my comments to
creating the header of the file.  By example, I require:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * File: FileName.java
 * Author:  Student name, &lt;official student e-mail&gt;
 * Assignment: Project 2 EE333 Fall 2006
 * Vers: 1.0.0 09/01/2006 dgg - initial coding
 *
 * Credits:  (if any for sections of code)
 */
</code></pre>

<p>Thru the menu option Tools | Templates, one can &ldquo;open in editor&rdquo; the selection
&ldquo;User.properties&rdquo; which is under &ldquo;User Configuration Properties&rdquo; in the
scrollable tree-oriented selection control.</p>

<p>There one can define a couple &ldquo;variables&rdquo; that are useful:</p>

<pre><code>user=Full name &lt;emailAddress&gt;
initials=dgg
course=EE333 Fall 2009
</code></pre>

<p>Then one can save this, and in the same area, select &ldquo;Java Class&rdquo; under &ldquo;Java&rdquo;
and adjust things so the template contains</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * File: ${name}.java
 * Author: ${user}
 * Assignment:  ${project.displayName} - ${course}
 * Vers: 1.0.0 ${date?date?string("MM/dd/yyyy")} ${initials} - initial coding
 *
 * Credits:  (if any for sections of code)
 */

&lt;#if package?? &amp;&amp; package != ""&gt;
package ${package};
&lt;/#if&gt;
/**
 *
 */
public class ${name} {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if one is doing work for multiple classes, another approach besides
&ldquo;$(course)&rdquo; might be appropriate.</p>

<p>For more information consult <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqTemplateVariables">FaqTemplateVariables</a> (variables in the
template) and <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqFreeMarker">FaqFreeMarker</a> (coding in template).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Update January 2013</h3>

<p>In NetBeans 7.2.1, the variables are now reachable with the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; button in the Templates dialog.</p>

<p>One may also wish to look at the license support in the default template and include it in your template.</p>

<h3>Update February 2020</h3>

<p>Changed my web site server link.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The old approach is no longer but valid but there is a <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/10433">new release</a> which
uses the service model.  I always use symbolic links over aliases as it works
at the command line.</p>

<p>The advantage of the alias over the symbolic link is it &ldquo;works&rdquo; or trys to
work even when you move the target file around.</p>

Interesting.  May have to try to remember what the three finger swipes do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.apple.com/macosx/images/buystrip_snow_box_20090824.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard" />I have now installed Snow Leopard on 3 machines (1 more to
go plus a server).</p>

<p>I had waited about a week and between the effort the vendors put in before the
release and the updates that came out a bit later, only a few issues arose
during the upgrade process.</p>

<p>I am able to use the built-in CISCO VPN support and after I fixed the
<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2009082703155512&amp;query=ipsec%2Bpassword">keychain access issue</a>, I did not have to supply my password every
connection.  I also learned that one can use CMD+SHIFT+G to change a browse
window to another directory including the ones that are not easily browsable
by the Apple GUI.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about conversion of e-mail from IMAP to Exchange servers to the new
Apple-Exchange 2007 Web Services approach in another post.</p>

<p>I did have to specifically upgrade Microsoft&rsquo;s Remote Desktop connection
product as it had not auto-updated (or informed me) to its <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974283">recent
release</a>.  It may be it just needed a &ldquo;re-install&rdquo; to insert special bits
somewhere.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://aloiroberto.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/snow-leopard-system-events-app-resolved/">others</a>, on one machine wanted to know where System Events.app was.
I was presented a GUI to browse to the file (and found it it in
System/Library/CoreServices.)</p>

<p>A few of the Mail.app plug-ins have not been upgraded yet.  These were
automatically disabled.</p>

<p>The DVD includes the latest Xcode (3.2) which I installed and Rosetta which is
an option item which I did not do yet.  I am going to try to do without the
old programs that only work natively on the PowerPC.  We will see.</p>

<p>Thank goodness Quicksilver still works.  That would be a loss even though
there is a new Google tool that is similar.  I modified it to search
/Developer for type com.apple.application to pick up those tools on one
machine &mdash; evidently I had already done it on my other development machine.</p>

<p>I turned Time Machine off on the one machine I use it on during the update and
for a couple days in case of the need to retreat.  I have restarted Time
Machine, but as one would expect, it is taking a while to catch up to such
massive changes to the disk.  Another approach would have been to flush the
past and just start the drive over.</p>

<p>Like others, I use applications hosted in Oracle.  Those applications are not
yet certified for Java 1.6 and one of them did not work with Safari at a
critical point in the application.  I found that if I set Safari to run in
32bit mode (most of my machines are Intel Duo Core 2 and thus 64 bit capable
to one degree or another), that the application worked as it did before the
upgrade. To choose 32bit mode, select the application in Finder, and then &ldquo;Get
Info&rdquo;.  On the pane, there is check box to run in 32 bit mode.</p>

<p>I have verified I can do SMB connections to printers and servers as well.</p>

<p>On one machine I had to fix my MacTeX installation in a minor way as
<a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/faq/#qm10">described by the MacTeX folks at Tug</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update this post if I remember (or encounter other things) in a bit.</p>

<p>All in all, much less traumatic than the move to Leopard and we will stay away
from discussion migrations in other OS&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><strong>Update 9/16/09:</strong> There seems to be a new 32b version of Java 1.6 in Snow
Leopard and there is no other version.  So while I had the experience reported
above, it seems I don&rsquo;t have an understanding of &ldquo;why&rdquo; and at this point,
after 10.6.1 patch (if that matters), my Oracle application is working in both
32bit and 64bit modes of Safari.</p>
