    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Watching the Twitter posts, it looks like a lot of work has gone
into building Octopress 3.0 around a somewhat different philosophy
than Octopress 2.0 making migration a challenge at present.</p>

<p><a href="http://justcurious.is/2014/octopress3/">Some have migrated themselves</a>, while the <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress/issues/30">author is discussing
a migration tool</a>.</p>

<p>I will wait a while and see what develops.  Octopress 2.0
continues to work so I can (or should) concentrate on blog content.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Oracle Java on OS X</h2>

<p>After moving to Oracle&rsquo;s Java to use on OS X, one finds a new System
Preference pane which launches a Java preferences App.  Included here is a
preset option to update Java.  However, one should note that if one installed
the JDK (Java Development Kit) as opposed to the JRE (Java Run Time
environment) <strong>only</strong> the JRE portion of the package is automatically updated.
It appears one has to manually download and update the JDK to get that portion
of the package updated.  Investigating a bit, it  looks like the attention is
on the JRE and only the linkages for the Applet usage are updated
automatically.  The JDK and its command line version of java are not updated
in addition to all the other components of the JDK.  This is probably not all
bad as it means the development environment does not change on you without
notice.</p>

<h2>NetBeans on OS X</h2>

<p>To update NetBeans, download a later version, start the new version and agree
to migration from  the earlier release.  Then, when you are ready to eliminate
the old version of NetBeans, go to the /Applications/NetBeans directory and
delete only that old version.</p>

<p>Update:  25 Jan 2014 &mdash; The template directory is made when the first
template is created.  On the Mac, it is located at <code>~/Library/Application\ Support/NetBeans/7.4/config/Templates</code>
and has a <code>Classes</code> directory and a <code>Properties</code> directory.  It appears that one can move the templates
from one config directory to a new one as part of migrating.</p>

    <link href="http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/07/08/using-mysql-with-bitnami-on-vagrant-vm/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-08T17:52:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/07/08/using-mysql-with-bitnami-on-vagrant-vm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/06/06/using-bitnamis-rubystack-on-virtualbox-linux-with-vagrant/">Bitnami install doccumented earlier</a> is a bit broken relative to MySQL.
Evidently, when Bitnami installs in the VM situation and moves itself to the <code>/opt/rubystack...</code>
directory, it expects to be a slightly more traditional install and use the userid mysql for
running the MySQL server.  However, the built databases are secured to the vagrant user account
(at least in my release).  This is relatively easy to confirm, try starting the server</p>

<pre><code> sudo ~/rubystack/ctlscript.sh start mysql
</code></pre>

<p>and not that it fails (after a bit).  One can look at the <code>mysqld.log</code> in <code>~/rubystack/mysql/data</code>
directory and see access errors.</p>

<p>The fix is to give the mysql user access to the MySQL data directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/rubystack/mysql  
sudo chown -R mysql.vagrant data
</code></pre>

<p>After this is done, the startup command should work.</p>

<h2>To start MySQL</h2>

<pre><code>cd rubystack  
sudo ./ctlscript.sh start mysql
</code></pre>

<h2>To stop MySQL</h2>

<pre><code>cd rubystack  
sudo ./ctlscript.sh stop mysql
</code></pre>

<h2>Create MySQL databases for dev, test, production</h2>

<p>The following sequence setups the development, test, and production databases for the
Rails project <em>tbd4students</em>.</p>

<pre><code>tbd4students&gt; mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE tbd4students_development DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tbd4students_development.* TO 'vagrant'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
CREATE DATABASE tbd4students_test DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tbd4students_test.* TO 'vagrant'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
CREATE DATABASE tbd4students_production DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tbd4students_production.* TO 'vagrant'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
EXIT;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the username <code>vagrant</code> (default in the VM) with a password of
&lsquo;<code>password</code>&rsquo; is used to access the server.  There is also a presumption that
the root password to the MySQL server is blank.  This configuration, of
course, is NO security and is only useful when on a closed system.  One should
research how to configure things more  securely for anything that will be
Internet (or even LAN) visible.</p>

App by the following process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the machine directory in your host machine using the command line</li>
<li>Start up the VM if it is not running <code>vagrant up</code></li>
<li>Connect to the machine <code>vagrant ssh</code></li>
<li><p>First time only, tell git who you are</p>

<pre><code>   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change to the directory that is shared between the guest OS and the host OS <code>cd /vagrant</code></p></li>
<li>Create a new Rails application <em>without</em> running bundler <code>rails new appname --skip-bundle</code></li>
<li>Install git&rsquo;s tracking repository <code>git init appname</code></li>
<li>Change to the application directory <code>cd appname</code></li>
<li>Update <code>.gitignore</code> to skip tracking <code>database.yml</code> <strong>You can edit this on the host side rather than the OS side if you like your local editor better but use one that likes Unix line endings (i.e. NOT Notepad).</strong></li>

    <updated>2013-06-06T01:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/06/06/using-bitnamis-rubystack-on-virtualbox-linux-with-vagrant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my Software Engineering Projects class, we are going to do a RAILS-based
project.  Based on feedback from last year&rsquo;s class, I am furnishing students
with an almost configured RAILS system for development.  The system is based on</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitnami.com/stack/ruby" title="Ruby Stack Cloud Hosting, Installers and Virtual Machines. - BitNami">Bitnami&rsquo;s Rubystack for 32 bit Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" title="Oracle VM VirtualBox">VirtualBox 4.2.12</a> as the VM</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" title="Vagrant">Vagrant 1.22</a> to help manage the install</li>
<li><a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/" title="Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (Precise Pangolin) - Ubuntu Releases">Ubuntu precise32</a> Linux</li>
</ul>


<h2>Create the base machine</h2>

<p>The <code>Vagrantfile</code> is configured to support networking from the host machine
and to run a configuration script (<code>script.sh</code>) as part of the provisioning.
There is a small bit of logic to avoid re-provisioning things each time the
machine is brought up.</p>

<p>I make it by following roughly the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li> Install Virtualbox</li>
<li> Install Vagrant</li>
<li> Create a directory to place files add in

<ul>
<li>The bitnami linux installer file</li>
<li><code>Vagrantfile</code></li>
<li><code>script.sh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Do an install:  <code>vagrant up</code></li>
<li> SSH into the running host:  <code>vagrant ssh</code></li>
<li> Use Linux as needed</li>
<li> Exit back to the host OS:  <code>exit</code></li>
<li> Shutdown the virtual machine (saving the contents):  <code>vagrant halt</code></li>
<li><p> Package the machine post configuration with <code>vagrant package default --output rails3r2e13.box</code></p></li>
<li><p> Restart the machine and continue work:  <code>vagrant up</code></p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Install the base machine on student computer</h2>

<p>OS X/Linux commands are given here, change the direction of the <code>/</code> (to <code>\</code>) for Windows.</p>

<ol>
<li> Install Virtualbox</li>
<li> Install Vagrant</li>
<li> Create a vms directory for your development use <code>mkdir vms</code></li>
<li> Create a machine1 directory <code>mkdir vms/machine1</code>  It will be accessible to both
 Linux and your operating system.</li>
<li> <code>cd vms/machine1</code></li>
<li> <code>vagrant init rails3r2e13.box url_to_image</code></li>
<li> uncomment <code>config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"</code> in Vagrantfile</li>
<li> <code>vagrant up</code>              # first time will download the vm machine</li>
<li> <code>vagrant ssh</code>             # if this fails, you need to put SSH on the path</li>
</ol>


<h2>SSH for Windows</h2>

<p>Windows does not include SSH by default.  Two options are to 1) install Git locally and then use it&rsquo;s SSH implementation and 2) <a href="http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ssh.html">install PuTTY</a>.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>The file <code>.bashrc</code> has a line at the end of it that maps the rails commands onto
the path along with library linkage as well.  This messes up some local commands
<code>nano</code> and others.  One solution is to comment out the line and re-log into the
VM.</p>

<h2>Other vagrant commands</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>vagrant destroy</code>  eliminate the virtual machine so next time it will be rebuilt</li>
<li><code>vagrant reload</code>  combination of of halt then up</li>
<li><code>vagrant suspend</code> pause machine copying state to disk, resume with `vagrant resule&#8220;</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Does it have to be this hard?</p>

<p>Anyway, if you are looking for how to add to a non-privileged user&rsquo;s
search path for command line usage, the command <code>setx</code> is what you are
looking for.  While it can be used to modify the system search path, users
don&rsquo;t have permission to do that in many enterprise deployments.
The paths specified by the user are at the end of the system paths.</p>

<p>To see the existing path</p>

<pre><code>    echo %path%

    C:\Ruby193\bin;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\
</code></pre>

<p>To put C:\Users\dgreen\bin on the path, use</p>

<pre><code>    setx path C:\Users\dgreen\bin
</code></pre>

<p>Once you start a new CMD session, you can see the impact of your changes.</p>

<pre><code>    echo %path%

    C:\Ruby193\bin;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;c:\Users\dgreen\bin

    <updated>2013-05-27T18:02:45-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/05/27/Tumbling-out</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a long overdue action, I have moved the glimmer blog out of Tumblr.  I had
been wanting to use <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">(Multi-)Markdown</a> more in blogging to continue my
focusing on the format.  I also had a student tell me he could not access the
Tumblr website at work due to its other content.  Tumblr was/is an easy to use
site but my purposes and those of other users don&rsquo;t seem to match.  I had been
looking at Jekyll for a while and considering what to try when I discovered
that GitHub supported web hosting with some support for Jekyll.  Finding the
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/">Jekyll importer</a> that would do most of the heavy lifting for
moving the site, I took the plunge.</p>

<p>Over about 4 hours, I was able to do fixups of the files that the importer
brought over.  I also changed Jekyll to use Kramdown instead of Maruku based
on  this <a href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/04/09/mostly-multimarkdown-blogging-in-octopress/">hint</a> originally from <a href="http://brettterpstra.com">Brett Terpstra</a>.</p>

<p>After a bit more exploring, I discovered Octopress which wraps Jekyll with
additional conveniences (even though it uses an older version of Jekyll).  I
was able to copy the raw Jekyll work into the <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a> copy.</p>

<p>After trying things out, I also made the decision to host against my Github
Account rather than a project (although both Jekyll and Octopress can handle
either approach.)  This was a bit hard to retreat to.  I had to</p>

<ol>
<li> Re-run scripts</li>
<li> Edit .git/config</li>
<li> Edit Rakefile</li>
<li> Edit _config</li>
</ol>


<p>but I think I got it.</p>

<p>Most &ldquo;irritating thing&rdquo; is to put <code>bundle exec</code> in front of all rake commands
as Octopress is not using more current code.  I have not generally had to
worry about that in the past but I know many others have.</p>

    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/04/14/safe-boot-is-back-in-os-x10-dot-8-3-with-filevault</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Safe booting for FileVault users is now possible again in OS X 10.8.3.  As always, you hold down the (left) shift key right after the chime when booting.  You are next taken to the unlock/login screen where you must authenticate by one of the accounts that will unlock the disk.  I hold the shift key down right after the &ldquo;return&rdquo; key is hit.  Then you will see the gray progress bar implying booting in safe mode.  After a while (probably after the fschk and other things are done but the progress bar only makes it about 40% across), it will go to the spinner for a while, then just the Apple, and then back to the unlock/login screen but you will notice a red &ldquo;<span style="color:red">Safe Boot</span>&rdquo; in the upper right hand corner.  After logging in again, one gets to the operating level of Safe Boot.  You will notice (as always) that your &ldquo;start at login&rdquo; items won&rsquo;t be loading &mdash; one of the features of Safe Boot.</p>

<p>On my old Mac Mini, things are pretty slow in Safe Boot.  It  must be disk intensive as my SSD-based MacBook Pro is much faster.</p>

<p>Since safe boot is the safe way to fix some things like</p>

<pre><code>Sandboxd: ... mdworker(..) deny mach-lookup com.apple.ls.boxd

<p>It is great to have this working again.</p>

    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2013/01/19/exploring-stately-for-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who has built a hardware-based Morse Code sending system, I am very interested in state machines and their implementation.</p>

<p>I recently found a new ruby gem <a href="https://github.com/rtwomey/stately">stately</a> which seemed interesting.  Like many packages, the documentation initially seemed confusing so a bit of exploring seemed appropriate.  This note documents the little exploring that I did (mostly so I can return to it should I want to use this gem in an application.  The two examples left when the dust settled are given in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/dgreen/d08cbdf7e52ed2cf0074">gist</a>.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to build a counter.  I had a bit of problem getting the syntax right and when I retreated to the document&rsquo;s examples,  I found they were incomplete.  My first successful attempt (from a syntax point of view was stately_demo_bad (see the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dgreen/d08cbdf7e52ed2cf0074#file-stately_demo_bad-rb">gist</a>).</p>

<p>It did not work because the method associated with defining all the details of the state machine appears to change the scope of some of the code into other internally defined classes yielding very unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>Moving everything to method (messages) inside the state machine seems to be the expected (and allowable) approach yielding stately_demo_good (see the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dgreen/d08cbdf7e52ed2cf0074#file-stately_demo_good-rb">gist</a>).</p>

    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2012/07/24/trading-memory-for-functionality-enough-performance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working on a the last note and wanted to check things out under a fresh
install. I decided to make a new Mac User to accomplish this. I used GitHub
for the Mac, Safari on the Assembla site and the Tumblr site, and the command
line. When I finsihed my work, I idlely was thinking about keeping this user
account around for the next effort or deleting it. One of the consideration
was how much space was in use by the account. I was shocked to see that the
home directory took 330MB!</p>

<p>Looking into it, I found the bit space was 300MB in Preferences. The other two
large directories was Caches (30MB) and Applications Support (12MB). Inside
preferences was a folder SMDHelpData that was the space user. This folder
evidently has the help file information: info, caches, and indexes for finding
things for all the applications on the system (not just those that had been
used). I am guessing there is a distinct copy per user since in theory at
least, one could through security settings block different users from various
components. There may also be some personalization (highlighting, last
location, etc.) capability.</p>

<p>I was very surprised at how much space was taken but I decided my lesson was
to also trade space for functionality (enough performance) and leave the user
configured so I would not spend time repeating the building of this space.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2012/07/21/github-with-assembla</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> has now made a nice simple GUI tool for both <a href="http://mac.github.com">OS X</a> and
<a href="http://windows.github.com">Windows</a>. They have made them freely available for download. They seem to
have made careful choices about what to support and not support in order to
keep tool as simple as possible. They do support using GitHub<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> against
other git repositories such as Assembla or a homegrown one. They don&rsquo;t support
multiple remote repositories for a specific local repository but you are free
to use GitHub.com for one project<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and Assembla (for example) for
another. The two limitations that I have seen that &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; sometimes are</p>

<ol>
<li> There is no graphical view of the change tree (while confusing, if you need it, alternatives are even more confusing)</li>
<li> The Windows and Mac Clients look different and behave a bit different.</li>
<li> Github really knows you by the name/email you list in it&rsquo;s configuration and does not like/support your having a separate identity on a per project basis.</li>
</ol>


<p>These limitations are not fundamental and Github.com may work on them in the
future. There have been frequent updates thus far to Github &mdash; perhaps they
will continue.</p>

<h2>Using GitHub with an existing project hosted in Assembla</h2>

<p>If this is your first use of Assembla (but assuming you already have an
account), then you will need to update your Assembla profile with your public
ssh key. This file may exist on your system <code>~/.ssh/pub.rsa</code> where <code>~</code> refers
to your home directory. You probably generated this as part of your git
install but if not (and after you possibily install ssh), use</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -C "demo@example.com" -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>substituing your email address. Take the defaults (hit return) on everything
unless there is an offer to overwrite the pub.rsa file AND you need the pre-
existing one! You will now a the file you need. Go to your profile in
Assembla, select manage keys and upload this file to assembla.</p>

<p>If there is no local repository associated with the existing project, you will
need to clone it using the command line. Assembla gives the step by step
instructions personalized for the repository (see the &ldquo;git clone&rdquo; information
near the top of the Source/Git tab). Be sure to use the &ldquo;clone/push URL&rdquo; if
you are planning to push back to Assembla in the future.</p>

<p>After you have a local repository (start here if you already had one), merely
start up GitHub, and use the menu to select <code>File | Add Local Repository</code>
option selecting the directory containing the project repository.</p>

<h2>Starting a new project with GitHub and Assembla</h2>

<p>Make your Assembla Space in Assembla selecting an option that includes
Source/Git repository. After it is made, you will be on a page that contains
very useful &ldquo;Getting started with Git&rdquo; instructions. For this note, I assume
you have installed git and configured it with your name and email.</p>

<p>If you are starting the project, create your repository folder as you would
any folder, perhaps</p>

<pre><code> mkdir demo
</code></pre>

<p>Attach a terminal window to this new directory (new project) or the existing
directory corresponding to the top of your existing project.</p>

<pre><code> cd demo
</code></pre>

<p>Then, assuming you have not been using git and a local respository only,
initialize git</p>

<pre><code> git init
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a new project, you need at least one file. Create one &mdash; prehaps a
readme.txt file.</p>

<pre><code> echo "" &gt; readme.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Out of scope for this note but if it is an existing project not yet in git,
you may wish to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files">set up a .gitignore file</a> to keep certain files (or file
types) from being tracked. We will assume we are tracking everything for
simplicity here.</p>

<p>Now, we need to add all new (or changed files)_for tracking and commit the
present state of the files to the local repository. We will use &ldquo;First commit&rdquo;
as the message about this commit. Adjust as desired but limit yourself to one
line of information unless you know how to do multiple lines as one command in
your terminal (command) program.</p>

<pre><code>git add .  
git commit -m "First commit"
</code></pre>

<p>Now configure the repository to know where the remote repository is in
Assembla. Be sure to use the customized one on your Assembla instructions.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin git@git.assembla.com:demo.git
</code></pre>

<p>where demo is the name of the remote repository as known to Assembla.</p>

<p>Finally, send your first commit up to the remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Success. You can now switch to Github as noted for an existing git reponsitory
above.</p>

<p>Things ran fine but when I moved it over to the iPad as an iBook file, I was
told it was an invalid format. Alas, googling did not help me (it has to
happen every once in a while).</p>

<p>After a goodly bit of exploring, the problem was the e-mail address in angle
brackets as part of the author information. I removed them and things were
good to go.</p>

    <link href="http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2012/01/21/adjusting-the-mac-os-x-path/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2012/01/21/adjusting-the-mac-os-x-path</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>path</strong> is an environmental variable that tells the command line (shell)
processor where to look for programs (commands) to run when they are entered
on the command line without any directory information. The shell will look for
the command in all the directories listed in the path variable.</p>

<p>In OS X, the active path can be shown when in the terminal window by typing
<code>echo $PATH</code> command on the command line (where <code>[user@system ~]$</code> is the
command line prompt and the text right before the &ldquo;]&rdquo; is the present working
directory (pwd). If it is &ldquo;~&rdquo; then it is the home directory of the user,
typically something like /Users/user (for a user named user).</p>

<pre><code> [user@system ~]$ echo $PATH
</code></pre>

<p>The path in OS X is maintained in several places:</p>

<ul>
<li>.bash_profile</li>
<li>.bashrc</li>
<li>system versions of the above</li>
<li>.MacOSX/environment.plist</li>
</ul>


<p>There a lot of references for the first three since this is roughly the same
as Linux/Unix assuming both systems are using the bash terminal shell. An
example is in <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2621/os_x_change_path_environment_variable/">Tech-Recipes</a>.</p>

<p>.MacOSX/environment.plist is obviously specialized to OS X, and this path
modification is seen by the GUI as well as command line programs run in the
terminal window. If the directory does not exist, you can make it at the
terminal prompt:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system ~]$ mkdir .MacOSX
</code></pre>

<p>Today, the file, if it exists, may be stored in binary rather than in text
form:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system ~]$ cd .MacOSX
[user@system .MacOSX]$ more environment.plist
"environment.plist" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?
</code></pre>

<p>is indicative of the file being binary. The command <code>plutil</code> can convert this
binary file to text oriented:</p>

<pre><code>[user@system .MacOSX]$ plutil -convert xml1 environment.plist
</code></pre>

<p>at this point, you can edit it carefully to contain your path. It must be a
complete collection where each path is separated by a &ldquo;:&rdquo; and the file must
obey XML rules. Mine looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;PATH&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/local/bin&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can either edit the file by hand with your favorite text editor, or if you
have Xcode installed, there is a tool to edit the file in a structured manner.
The tool may be able to work without conversion from binary to xml.</p>

<p>After editing the file, you may wish to convert it back to binary (although I
don&rsquo;t think it is necessary) by</p>

<pre><code>[user@system .MacOSX]$ plutil -convert binary1 environment.plist
</code></pre>

<p>After changing this file, you will have to either logout or reboot so that all
the OS X parts associated with your login will use this new path.</p>

<p>Interesting positive story about Dropbox&#8217;s beginnings. Seems a lot
less antagonistic than many. Evidently 68 accounts got exposed when the

    <id>http://dgreen.github.io/blog/2011/12/01/ical-does-not-delete-old-events-cleanly-imo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I turned on (for a few minutes) deletions of iCal events. Some of my calendars
are hosted in Exchange and some on Google. Some of these events are group
meetings with group scheduling in place. My calendar appointments with other
individuals are both inside the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Google&rdquo; space and outside.</p>

<p>iCal is notifying all these individuals of the deleted group meetings (from 2
or more years ago since I said delete after 730 days) that the meeting has
been canceled. Of course, it happened long ago &mdash; it was not cancelled. Alas,
all of these individuals are getting e-mail announcing these cancelations from
me (via automated iCal behavior).</p>

<p>Broke, broke, broke!</p>

<p>(bug report submitted to Apple, there are discussions in the Apple Forum on
this issue.)</p>
