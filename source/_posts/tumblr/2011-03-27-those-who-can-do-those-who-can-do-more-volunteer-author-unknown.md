--[Volunteer Appreciation Quotes, Sayings of Thanks for Volunteering][1]. This
web page has many good quotes related to volunteering. I was originally drawn
here by a colleague's email quote "Volunteers do not necessarily have the
time; they just have the heart." attributed on this web page to Elizabeth
Andrew. Google took the quote and found this page.
