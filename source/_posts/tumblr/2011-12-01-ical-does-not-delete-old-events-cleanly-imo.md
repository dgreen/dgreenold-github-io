title: iCal does not delete old events cleanly IMO
tags: 
---
I turned on (for a few minutes) deletions of iCal events. Some of my calendars
are hosted in Exchange and some on Google. Some of these events are group
meetings with group scheduling in place. My calendar appointments with other
individuals are both inside the "Exchange" and/or "Google" space and outside.

iCal is notifying all these individuals of the deleted group meetings (from 2
or more years ago since I said delete after 730 days) that the meeting has
been canceled. Of course, it happened long ago -- it was not cancelled. Alas,
all of these individuals are getting e-mail announcing these cancelations from
me (via automated iCal behavior).

Broke, broke, broke!

(bug report submitted to Apple, there are discussions in the Apple Forum on
this issue.)
