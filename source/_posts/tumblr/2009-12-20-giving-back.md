[![Wikipedia Affiliate Button][1]][2]Not meaning to turn this into a
significant advocacy post but similar to the public supporting resources like
Public Radio (mine is [WBHM][3]) and Public TV (mine is [APT][4]), it appears
that [Wikipedia needs support for its continuing operation][5]. Â I don't know
about you but like the other two resources, I have benefited greatly from this
Internet resource and I feel it is worth supporting.
