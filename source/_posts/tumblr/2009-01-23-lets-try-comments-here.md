Reading the FAQ from Tumblr suggests that one can use DisQus and some code to
enable commenting on a Tumblr.  I have completed the steps and am doing this
on a tentative basis.  It looks like commenters should expect to have to
create an account on DisQus before being able to post.

Let me know if this is worthwhile.
