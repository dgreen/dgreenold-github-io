My wife asked me about a strange number that had shown up on her cell phone.
She went to the Google and found out that it had been reported by others.
Some as "what is this?", some for bill collectors, some for solicitations,
etc.

It turns out I that I had called her using Skype and I don't have a caller-id
number set to my cell phone or a SKYPE IN number so the dial out number is
from a pool and that pool number gets a lot of use.  Of course, no is posting
"my husband" called on this number since those with explanation (and
presumably desired calls) don't generate the energy to post to the net.

The solution choices seem to be to

  1. buy SKYPE IN to get a specific number  $75/yr (plus ability for folks to
call in)

  2. map number to one's cell phone

  3. map number to one's Google Voice number

  4. live with issue

I was going to try choice #3.  To do this, the Google Voice number has to
receive SMS.  One way to do this is to map SMS messages to Google Voice to
one's e-mail.  Note it costs you $0.11 on Skype to send the configuration
message.  After a substantial number for $0.11 attempts, I was not able to get
the underlying SMS message (it never showed in Google Mail.)  So for the
moment, I am using option 4 while I weigh the tradeoffs.
