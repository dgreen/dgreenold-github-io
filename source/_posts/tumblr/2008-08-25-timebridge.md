Another neat web service:  [Timebridge][1].  This service helps one schedule
meetings with colleagues.  You pick out several choices for the meeting, the
system queries users about their choices and the meeting time is resolved.
Things get even nicer if participants share their Google or Outlook calendars
with the service.  Then the scheduler has free-busy information to increase
the probability that the chosen meeting times "work".
