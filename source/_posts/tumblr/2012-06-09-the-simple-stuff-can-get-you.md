I was trying out the EPUB export of [VoodooPad][1] and figured out I had to
make a cover page in the tool as well as a collection. I then filled out the
metadata including author information (David Green <userid@site.com>) and then
saved with an .epub extension.

Things ran fine but when I moved it over to the iPad as an iBook file, I was
told it was an invalid format. Alas, googling did not help me (it has to
happen every once in a while).

After a goodly bit of exploring, the problem was the e-mail address in angle
brackets as part of the author information. I removed them and things were
good to go.
