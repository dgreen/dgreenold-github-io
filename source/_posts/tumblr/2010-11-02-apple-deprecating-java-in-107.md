In [Apple Trying to Ditch Java from Mac OS X, But Why? by Cory Bohon on
Mac|Life][1] the author reviews Apple's recent announcement and his take on
the situation. Worth reading and thinking about.

List me as disappointed in this Apple decision. I understand that Java is now
considered one of those technologies that are the source of security risks on
platforms. This is chiefly because the update approach is such that platforms
do not stay current. It would seem that eliminating Java from the browser
makes sense, eliminating it from servers does not, and eliminating it from the
desktop is the topic under discussion by security folks. I understand Apple
has to invest resources to keep the tool current and it must be prioritized
against other needs.

Apple adds significant platform value to Java in making Java work better with
Cocoa (and both 32 bit and 64 bit). Many developers feel that the Mac is a
good development platform for that reason. The ability to have software that
with low effort can exist on multiple platforms is valuable and a lot of
progress has been made on this. Tools like OpenProj, XMind, NetBeans, Eclipse,
MoneyDance and OpenOffice are great examples of the merits of this approach.
Additionally, there are other Mac applications that are Java-based or
partially java-based including OmniPlan (the MPX conversion), OpenProj, XMind,
parts of Acorn, CocoaMySQL, Locomotive (old Rails Tool), MatLab, NoteTaker,
Plot, Screenium, SEEdit Maxi II, and Service Scrubber.
