title: The (slightly) big e-mail experiment
tags:

Well I did it.  I have moved my IEEE mail over to GMail from my university
mail.  I still can use the Apple Mail integrated client and the iPhone to
monitor both mail sources so my client side tools are relatively unchanged.

This will force me to explore the use of the Google client further.  I think I
have fixed all the From: issues so @ieee.org still shows up in my from address
but time will tell.  I am not using it again (yet) but if I were not use the
imap client to Google, I would probably use [MailPlane][1] to provide various
Mac interoperability's.

Being the new year, I also purged old mail into an offline store (EagleFiler)
and reorganized my filing system.  Google uses Tags rather than folders and
nesting does not make a lot of sense there.   I also find myself searching
more than using the hierarchical folder system so I have reduced (but not
eliminated) the number of tags/folders.  I used Mail.app's IMAP capability to
move the files from from one system to the other.
