In an [earlier post][1], I cited a particular lecture of a course series.  I
am now 8 lectures into the [series on power mind mapping][2] by NovaMind.
They, of course, use their product for the answer but it has some valuable
information for all who are trying to use Mind Mapping on any product (or with
pencil and paper.)  When you sign up, they send you a lecture every two days
for about a month.
