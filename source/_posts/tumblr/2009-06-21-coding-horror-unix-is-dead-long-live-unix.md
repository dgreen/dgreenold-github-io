[Coding Horror: Unix is Dead, Long Live Unix][1]

> A short commentary on Unix which has now been around for 40 years.
Particularly humbling to me is the revelation (to me) that the first Unix was
written in 3 weeks:  one week for the OS, one week for the shell and one week
on an editorassembler == all writen in assembly language for a PDP-7.  This
article has a link to another article with considerably more information.
