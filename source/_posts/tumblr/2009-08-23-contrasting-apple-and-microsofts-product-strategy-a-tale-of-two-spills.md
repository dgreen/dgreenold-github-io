[Contrasting Apple and Microsoft’s Product Strategy: A Tale of Two Spills][1]

> From | Pathfinder Software Development | Blogs . 

I have given this story in other forms:

  * Using a video projector
  * Putting the machine to sleep
  * Migrating to a newer machine
  * Connecting a new printer

Etc.

My punch line:  no doubt the ease of use and better designed experience are
worth the money once you experience them.  It is harder to see how one pushes
that "promise" to someone who has not yet made the buy decision and is
focusing on the incremental cost.  So far, it seems that it usually takes an
acquaintance who has already been through it to help.

The other way for a few is the Mac Mini which lowers but does not eliminate
the differential.
