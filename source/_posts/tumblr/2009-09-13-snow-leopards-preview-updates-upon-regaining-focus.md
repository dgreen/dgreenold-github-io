title: Snow Leopard's Preview Updates upon regaining focus

Preview.app (the PDF and graphic viewer) will update itself to changes in the
underlying file when it gains focus. That makes it more valuable for
applications like LaTeX where one is changing the PDF and using Preview to
judge the results.
