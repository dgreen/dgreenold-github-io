[Testing Legacy Rails Apps » SlideShare][1]

> Wow, another web 2.0 too &#8212; SlideShare. Looks like getting the
transcript with the slides may be some work.

Looks like there are free accounts for doing this.

The lead-in to free accounts say you can upload ppt, pps, odp, pdf, and
keynote and share the link or embed in your blog.
