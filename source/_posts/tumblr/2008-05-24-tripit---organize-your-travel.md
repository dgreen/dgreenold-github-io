[TripIt - Organize your travel][1]

trips.  You send your trip information (hotel confirmation or air travel
confirmation, etc.) to plans@tripit.com .  TripIt brings sends you a reply
which gets to build an account (if the first time), and to manage your trip
information.  TripIt is smart enough to parse your information into a more
meaningful format.

You can get an .ics feed to integrate the information back into your calendar.
You can collaborate on trips as desired.

Finally, there is a "clipit" tool that works with many browsers that allows
you to add information from around the web into your trip plan.
