title: Printing Multiple Files in NetBeans
tags:
- netbeans
---
I wanted to produce a collection of PDF files associated with the source of an
applications developed in NetBeans (6.9). The File | Print option in Project
view just prints (or sends to PDF) one source file even if multiple files have
focus.

The trick is to switch to the Files view (rather than the Project view). Then
selecting all the files, open them, then choose Print gives the desired
result.
