[MultiMarkdown and Scrivener for Efficient Blogging][1]

This article (click the title) discusses two tools I use quite a lot. [MultiMarkdown][2]
is the tool I use to make most of my static web content these days. Scrivener
helps with the composing effort. Both tools are available for Windows as well
as OS X although Scrivener is only beta software on Windows today.
