[Onto the iPhone][1]

> OK, I have joined the club and now am an iPhone user.

I am coming from many years using using a Palm Treo 650. It was getting rather
dated as well as starting to move down the unsupported curve. It finally
developed a crack on the face plate that killed the stylus capability.

I have found the iPhone to be rather easy to use -- perhaps due to a lot of
pre-purchase reading and video watching.

Off to the app store for the Omnifocus app, the multi-service IM client
(BeeJiveIM), and this Tumbler client (Tumblrette) which I used to make this
post.
