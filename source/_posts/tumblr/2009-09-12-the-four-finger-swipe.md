title: The four-finger swipe

Last post for today.  On suitably new portable Mac's, one can do a 4-finger
swipe which seems to be the equivalent of the Windows ALT+TAB  (and the Mac
CMD+TAB) so one can through the pad get to all running applications.
Interesting.  May have to try to remember what the three finger swipes do.
