[Doodle][1] is a neat tool for scheduling efforts of people across systems. I
use it a lot both for UAB and IEEE activities. Once one builds an account it
becomes even more valuable remembering the meetings you are setting up as well
as the meetings you have responded to that are hosted by others. Doodle can
also handle 1) time zones and 2) "if I have to" as well as yes/no meetings
<G>. With an account, one can link a Doodle .ics feed into one's calendar to
remember promises made.

_Best practice 1_ -- Meeting planners shall use timezones. It may only seem
"friendly" to do this when meetings are across timezones but it really is
mandatory since folks who use .ics feeds have their calendars messed up if the
wrong timezones are fed in. This is settable on the screen where one fills in
the data. The timezone should be recognized by Doodle, i.e. don't use ET for
EDST or EST.

_Best practice 2_ -- Meeting planners should consider the use of "if need be"
to allow folks to give the maximum information in trying to find a meeting
time. This is set in the Options tab after the schedule is established.

_Best practice 3_ -- Meeting planners shall go back to mark the final meeting
time choice. This locks in the date and time and removes all other tentative
times from .ics feeds thus clearing those non-needed time slots from the
attendees calendars. This action is done using the administer link.

Updated 2 June 2011 to note that psuedo timezones like ET should NOT be used.
