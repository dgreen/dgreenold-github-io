title: There is security and then there is security...

Back in an [earlier post][1], I lamented about some of the errors made by
DropBox that (greatly) reduced the security on data and how I was looking at
SpiderOak.

I am now reporting that the experiment with SpiderOak is now complete. I have
had three occasions where it has lost (many) items during it's syncing. I
forgave the first one as I had changed things on it real quick and SpiderOak
is slow to sync (in 10-15 minute range). The second situation occurred when
networking went very unreliable during a storm. I don't really know (nor care)
what the third cause was. I am to the point that I am greatly afraid I won't
notice a loss till it has happened in the too distant past.

On these losses, I have both Time Machine and (probably) SpiderOak retrievals
of the lost data so I hopefully am able to recover all the data without a
great deal of pain (i.e. regenerating it).

However, it is tremendously less security from loss than with DropBox even
though it is, by architecture, less likely to expose my information to third
parties.

Where to next? I will be splitting my data between Dropbox and non-replicated
data that needs to stay private as well as terminating my SpiderOak account.
