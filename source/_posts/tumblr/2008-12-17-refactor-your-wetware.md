title: Refactor Your Wetware

I am reading an interesting book - _[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor
Your Wetware][1]_ by Andy Hunt that came out in September 2008.  The book
works through a collection of science associated with the brain in a very
readable manner with the goal that by understanding how the brain works, one
can improve their thinking skills.  Lots of interesting ideas to consider
applying.
