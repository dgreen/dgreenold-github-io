Gideon King of NovaMind is producing a free series of video courses on using
MindMaps.  Lesson 2: [Power Mind Mapping lesson 2 - using Mind Mapping
techniques to solve problem][1] is a good overview of the structured problem
solving method regardless of whether one uses Mindmaps or not.  He is using
the NovaMind map product for his presentation tool so you see some value in
organizing presentations with Mindmaps as a side effect of looking at this
lesson.
