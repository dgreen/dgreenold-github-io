title: 'Track Padding...'

I have switched to Lion along with much of the rest of the world. Trying
out the track pad as well. One of the things I have not heard mentioned is the
two-finger scroll horizontally in the browser which does the same action as in
back and forward buttons of the browser. The movie demonstrates the visual
result of slowly doing the forward  back. Probably not worth much in work flow
but technically and visually neat.
