Am I the only one is bothered by having Apple iTunes drop your purchase
request when Apple decides to change their terms and forces you to agree to
the new terms? I should be able to abort a sale but not have it automatically
dumped. Bummer!

There is also something very disconcerting about 55 (iPhone) pages of terms
being present. It seems as if (Apple) lawyers are unable to simplify things
for the user. Imagine if the app was similarly unable to simplify things!
