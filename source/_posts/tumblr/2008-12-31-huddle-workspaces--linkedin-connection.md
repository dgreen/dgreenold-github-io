[Huddle Workspaces & LinkedIn Connection][1]

><p>Looking around for other tools in the 37Signals Campfire (which I like)
space and found &#8220;Huddle&#8221; which seems more formal (which could be
good or bad) and has the ability to interoperate with LinkedIn perhaps
mitigating the useridpassword admin chore for maintaining things.
