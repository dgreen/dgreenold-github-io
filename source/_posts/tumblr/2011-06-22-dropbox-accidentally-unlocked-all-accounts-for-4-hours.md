[Dropbox Accidentally Unlocked All Accounts for 4 Hours][1]

The most security related bungle of Dropbox is linked to the title of this
post (which is also the title of the blog entry reporting the problem. There
have been other ones recently where it has been documented that their terms of
service (relative to security) were, at best, ambiguous if not misleading. I
am looking at whether to stay with them or not. They don&#8217;t meet my
security requirements for some content (like student grades) and I have been
using a &#8220;treat the secret content special&#8221; while using Dropbox for
the routine. I really like the concept and the user side is quite intuitive
and friendly but at some point, the security bobbles become
&#8220;risks&#8221; of more bobbles rather than one-off problems.

I have looked at SpiderOak. It too will sync between the machines with the
encryption done (and maintained) as the information moves the cloud. The
service model is a bit different with more options making it better geek-wise
and more confusing user-wise. Initial playing suggests it feels a bit slower
than dropbox but on a 300MB file it actually beat drop box to a complete sync.
