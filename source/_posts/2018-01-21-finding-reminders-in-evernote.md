Here is a hint that I was not able to find quickly in Google nor in the EverNote help.

Enter "Reminders" into the Search Bar and then select "Notes with Reminders" to find all
notes that have reminders.  Very logical but took a few minutes and hopefully this
short post will same someone else a few.
