Watching the Twitter posts, it looks like a lot of work has gone
into building Octopress 3.0 around a somewhat different philosophy
than Octopress 2.0 making migration a challenge at present.

[Some have migrated themselves][self], while the [author is discussing
a migration tool][tool].

I will wait a while and see what develops.  Octopress 2.0 
continues to work so I can (or should) concentrate on blog content.
